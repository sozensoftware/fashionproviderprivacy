Privacy Policy for AI Fashion Advisor
Last Updated: June 27, 2025
Thank you for choosing AI Fashion Advisor! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application ("App"). Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. By using AI Fashion Advisor, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
1. Information We Collect
To provide and improve our services, we collect the following types of information:
a) Information You Provide Directly:
Images: When you use our core feature, you upload photographs of your outfits or clothing items. These images are essential for the AI to perform a style analysis.
Analysis and Occasion Data: You may provide context for your analysis, such as the occasion type (e.g., "Work," "Party," "Casual"). This information helps our AI provide more relevant advice.
Contact Information: If you contact us for support via email, we will collect your email address (sozensoftware@gmail.com) and any other information you choose to provide in your correspondence.
b) Information Collected Automatically:
Usage Data: We may collect anonymous data about your interactions with the App, such as which features you use, the frequency of use, and crash reports. This helps us understand how our App is being used so we can improve the user experience. This data is aggregated and does not personally identify you.
Device Information: We may collect non-personal information about your device, such as the device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers for analytics and troubleshooting purposes.
c) Subscription Information (Handled by RevenueCat):
If you choose to subscribe to our Premium service, the payment is processed by Apple (App Store). We do not collect or store your credit card details. We use a third-party service, RevenueCat, to manage subscription statuses. RevenueCat provides us with an anonymous user ID to confirm your subscription status (e.g., whether you are a premium user) but does not share your personal payment information with us.
2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
To Provide the Core Service: Your uploaded images and context data are sent to a third-party AI service, Google's Gemini AI, to generate style advice and analysis. The images are used solely for this analysis and are not used for any other purpose.
To Improve Our App: We use anonymous usage data to understand user behavior, identify popular features, fix bugs, and enhance the overall functionality of AI Fashion Advisor.
To Manage Subscriptions: We use information from RevenueCat to verify your premium status and unlock premium features.
To Provide Customer Support: If you contact us, we use your information to respond to your inquiries and provide assistance.
3. Data Processing and Third-Party Services
Google Gemini AI: To provide fashion advice, your images are processed by Google's Gemini AI model. Google's use of this data is governed by their API terms and privacy policies. We send the image for the sole purpose of generating a one-time analysis and do not permit Google to use your images to train their models.
RevenueCat: We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. Their privacy policy can be found on their website.
Image Storage: User-uploaded images for analysis are processed in-memory or stored temporarily on our secure servers only for the duration required to perform the AI analysis. They are automatically and permanently deleted immediately after the analysis is complete. We do not build a permanent database of your un-saved analysis images.
Saved History: If you choose to save an analysis to your history, the image and its associated advice text are stored locally on your device using secure, on-device storage (Hive). This data does not leave your device unless you choose to back it up via iCloud or other device backup services.
4. Data Security
We are committed to protecting your information. We implement a variety of security measures, including encryption and secure server protocols, to maintain the safety of your personal information. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
5. User Rights and Data Control
You have control over your data:
Access and Deletion of History: You can access and delete any saved analysis from the "History" section within the App at any time. Deleting an item from your history permanently removes the associated image and advice from your device.
Camera and Photo Access: You can grant or revoke access to your camera and photo library at any time through your device's settings. Please note that revoking access will prevent you from using the core analysis features of the App.
6. Children's Privacy
AI Fashion Advisor is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information immediately.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
